# PapilduPrekyba
Repository for a project that was done during the course of a semester to learn about databases and SQL. 
To run the project XAMPP must be installed (or a similar app) and Apache with MySQL must be running. Then the project can be run without any problems.
To see the running program, go to localhost:5000 in your browser.
